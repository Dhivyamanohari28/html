        <h1>ICE CREAMS</h1>
        <h2>BLACK CURRENT</h2>
        <p>This is a no churn ice cream with great flavor! Those tiny blackcurrant berries are perfect in ice creams and baked goods.<br>Blackcurrants are one of the super fruits! <br>
            They have more vitamin C than oranges and contain more antioxidants than blueberries.
            <br>They are a delicious ingredient in baked goods, syrups, jams, drinks or ice creams.<br> 
            These berries had been banned in the US for almost 100 years. (Check out why blackcurrants were a forbidden fruit in the US and why you should eat them!)
