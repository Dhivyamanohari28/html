        <h2>ALL JAVA METHODS</h2>
        <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
            
            Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
            
            Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
